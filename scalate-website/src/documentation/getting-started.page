# Introduction

Lets try and get you up to speed using Scalate as quickly as possible.

This guide will assume you have a reasonably recent installation of [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), say version 2.0.9 or later. If you don't, please [install one now](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).

# Create a project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets use one of the Scalate Maven archetypes to create a new [Jog](jog.html) project that we can use as a base on which to build.

In a command line type this:

    mvn archetype:create \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.fusesource.scalate.tooling \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=scalate-archetype-guice \
      -DarchetypeVersion={project_version:} \
      -DgroupId=myGroup -DartifactId=myArtifact 
    
You might want to change the last line changing *myGroup* and *myArtifact* to whatever maven groupId and artifactId you want to use.

Now you've successfully created a base [Jog](jog.html) project using Scalate, Scala, [Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/) and [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).

Now change directory to the new *myArtifact* directory (or whatever name you used)  

    cd myArtifact  
</div>

<div class="left" markdown="1">
# Run the new project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
To run the project run the following command

    mvn jetty:run
    
Now when the application starts up you should be able to point your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run the application.
