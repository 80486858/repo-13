<div class="right" markdown="1">
The *{project_name:}* project stores it's source code in a Subversion repository at: 

  [{project_svn_url:}]({project_svn_url:})
  
Only project developers can commit to the Subversion repository.  We use the trunk for the next main release; then we use a branch for any bug fixes on the previous major release. You can look at a specific branch here:

  [{project_svn_branches_url:}]({project_svn_branches_url:})
  
To build the code see [Building]({relocatable: building.html})
