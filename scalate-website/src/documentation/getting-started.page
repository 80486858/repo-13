# Getting Started
Lets get scalating!

# Introduction
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets try and get you up to speed using Scalate as quickly as possible.

This guide will assume you have a reasonably recent installation of [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), say version 2.0.9 or later. If you don't, please [install one now](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).

</div>

# Create a project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets create a new [Jog](jog.html) project that we can use as a base on which to build.

If you have not done so already [install the Scalate Tool](tool.html). If you prefer you can create projects using the [Scalate Maven archetypes via maven](archetypes.html) instead of using Scalate Tool

To see all of the available commands type this command into a command terminal

      scalate

Now to create a new project type 

      scalate guice myGroup myArtifact
    
You might want to change **myGroup** and **myArtifact** to whatever maven groupId and artifactId you want to use. 

Now change directory to the newly created **myArtifact** directory (or whatever name you used for the artifactId)  

      cd myArtifact  
    
You should now see a directory tree something like this

      |-src
      |---main
      |-----resources
      |-----scala
      |-------myGroup
      |-----webapp
      |-------WEB-INF
      |---test
      |-----scala
      |-------myGroup

If this step didn't work, [let us know](../community.html)!

Hopefully you now have a base [Jog](jog.html) project using Scalate, Scala, [Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/) and [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).

# Run the new project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
To run the project run the following command

      mvn jetty:run
    
Now when the application starts up you should be able to point your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run the application.

Your application is now ready for you to create new JAXRS resource beans (in Scala or Java code) as well as rendering any Scalate templates in the **src/main/webapp** directory.

To start hacking on a template, try editing the **src/main/webapp/index.scaml** file which is used to render the home page (a [Scaml](scaml-reference.html) template). Or try adding new templates. 

For more detail on how the web application works please refer to the [Jog documentation](jog.html)

# Scalate console
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
While looking at the [home page](http://localhost:8080) of your running application you should see a little icon near the top right of the screen which opens/closes the [Scalate Console](console.html). Try opening it and try out its links.

The [Scalate Console](console.html) provides nice error messages if you make a typo in a template together with edit links to the source code, plus provides handy links to the current source, templates and layouts you are viewing in development mode along with a number of other features. 

Please refer to the [Console documentation](console.html) for more detail.

# Diving deeper
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Once you have the application working and you've played with the [Console](console.html) you might want to dive deeper into Scalate and understand how it works.

* [WAR Overlay](war-overlay.html) describes how we use a WAR overlay to include the [Console](console.html) in your application
* [Scalate Console](console.html)
* [Documentation](documentation.html) for further information on user guides and template references
