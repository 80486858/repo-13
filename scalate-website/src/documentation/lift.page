Using Scalate with Lift

# Overview

<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lift is a popular Scala based web framework with particularly powerful Comet support.

Support for Scalate has been added to Lift in the Scala 2.8.0 branch. For more details see [ticket 475](https://liftweb.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/tickets/475).

# Example

<div class="right" markdown="1">
There is a [helloscalate](http://github.com/lift/lift/tree/280_RC7/examples/helloscalate/) sample which shows you how you can integrate Scalate views into Lift

The trick to enabling Scalate is to enable the ScalateView in your Boot.scala class such as in [this example](http://github.com/lift/lift/blob/280_RC7/examples/helloscalate/src/main/scala/bootstrap/liftweb/Boot.scala).

The following code should do the trick

    new ScalateView.register
