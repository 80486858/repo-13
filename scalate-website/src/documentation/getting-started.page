# Getting Started
Lets get scalating!

# Introduction
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets try and get you up to speed using Scalate as quickly as possible.

This guide will assume you have a reasonably recent installation of [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), say version 2.0.9 or later. If you don't, please [install one now](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).

# Create a project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets use one of the Scalate Maven archetypes to create a new [Jog](jog.html) project that we can use as a base on which to build.

In a command line type this:

    mvn archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.fusesource.scalate.tooling \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=scalate-archetype-guice \
      -DarchetypeVersion=1.0 \
      -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/repositories/public \
      -DgroupId=myGroup -DartifactId=myArtifact -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
    
You might want to change the last line changing *myGroup* and *myArtifact* to whatever maven groupId and artifactId you want to use.

The maven archetype plugin will ask you to hit enter to confirm those settings.

Now change directory to the new *myArtifact* directory (or whatever name you used for the artifactId)  

    cd myArtifact  
    
You should now see a directory tree something like this

    |-src
    |---main
    |-----resources
    |-----scala
    |-------myGroup
    |-----webapp
    |-------WEB-INF
    |---test
    |-----scala
    |-------myGroup

If this step didn't work, [let us know](../community.html)!

Hopefully you now have a base [Jog](jog.html) project using Scalate, Scala, [Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/) and [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).

## Using the latest snapshot

If you want to take advantage of any improvements in the console and archetypes since the {project_version:} release you can use this mechanism of creating the archetype

    mvn archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.fusesource.scalate.tooling \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=scalate-archetype-guice \
      -DarchetypeVersion={project_snapshot_version:} \
      -DarchetypeRepository=http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots \
      -DgroupId=myGroup -DartifactId=myArtifact -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT

This will use the latest snapshot of the archetype instead.

# Run the new project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
To run the project run the following command

    mvn jetty:run
    
Now when the application starts up you should be able to point your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run the application.

Your application is now ready for you to create new JAXRS resource beans (in Scala or Java code) as well as rendering any Scalate templates in the **src/main/webapp** directory.

To start hacking on a template, try editing the **src/main/webapp/index.scaml** file which is used to render the home page (a [Scaml](scaml-reference.html) template). Or try adding new templates. 

For more detail on how the web application works please refer to the [Jog documentation](jog.html)

# Scalate console
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
While looking at the [home page](http://localhost:8080) of your running application you should see a little icon near the top right of the screen which opens/closes the [Scalate Console](console.html). Try opening it and try out its links.

The [Scalate Console](console.html) provides nice error messages if you make a typo in a template together with edit links to the source code, plus provides handy links to the current source, templates and layouts you are viewing in development mode along with a number of other features. 

Please refer to the [Console documentation](console.html) for more detail.
