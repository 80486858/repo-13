# Site Generator

Create that static website with Scalate

# Overview
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Scalate can be used to create a static website reusing all of the various Scalate template languages, filters, wiki markups and pipelines. 

First you need to install the [Scalate tool](tool.html)

# Creating a Site
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
  
The quickest way to get started right now is to create a copy of the **scalate-sample-sitegen** project.

Inside the project run the following

    mvn jetty:run
    
Then open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see the styled website.

The source for the site in wiki markup or templates are all in the usual webapp area (**src/main/webapp**).

However you can also use the [Console](console.html) to edit the templates directly. 

Just open the console via the top right icon. You will then see links to the page you are looking at along with the layout template used to render the current page. Clicking on the link will open the wiki page or template in your editor. Refer to the [Console](console.html) for details of changing your default editor.    

When you change a file and hit save you can hit reload in your browser to see the newly rendered page. Whether you change a wiki page, an include or a template you will always see the most up to date page in your browser.

# Generating the static site
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
  
To generate the static site run

    mvn install
    
This will invoke the **scalate:sitegen** plugin which generates the static website to the **target/sitegen** directory.

# Using LiveReload
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
  
[LiveReload](http://github.com/mockko/livereload) is a tool and a browser plugin for Safari and Chrome. 

    runlivereload
    
LiveReload watches the files on your machine so that as you change a template, CSS or JavaScript file it will force a reload in the web browser. This means you can sit in your editor changing files and have a browser window open and you don't have to keep changing focus between the editor and browser and hitting reload in the browser. You can just hit save in your editor and see the results in your browser.
    
Or you can use the livereload script directly...

    livereload src/main/webapp
    
        
This works thanks to the **src/main/webapp/.livereload** configuration file knowing about the scalate template files.

# Exporting Confluence Wikis
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
  
If you have a legacy site you want to port over from Confluence you can run the following command.
  
For example if your Confluence space is called FOO at Apache then the following command will dump its content as wiki text files...

    scalate confexport --user user --password pass \
      https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/rpc/xmlrpc FOO ./out

</div>
