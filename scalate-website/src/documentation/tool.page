Scatate Tool is a handy command line tool for creating new projects using Scalate. 

Scalate Tool has the following requirements

* Scalate requires a [Java development kit](http://java.sun.com/) of version 1.5 or later

To get started with the Scalate Tool you'll need to download and install it.

[Download a distribution](download.html) such as [1.1-SNAPSHOT zip](http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.fusesource.scalate&a=scalate-distro&v=1.1-SNAPSHOT&e=zip&c=windows-bin) or [tar.gz](http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=org.fusesource.scalate&a=scalate-distro&v=1.1-SNAPSHOT&e=tar.gz&c=unix-bin)

* Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. **scalate-{project_new_version:}-windows-bin.zip** to the directory you wish to install Scalate {project_new_version:}. These instructions assume you chose **C:\Program Files\Scala**. The subdirectory scalate-{project_new_version:} will be created from the archive.
* Add the **C:\Program Files\Scala\scalate-{project_new_version:}** directory to the **PATH** environment variable by 
  * Opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause)
  * Selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button
  * Update/create the PATH variable in the user variables prepending the value **C:\Program Files\Scala\scalate-{project_new_version:}** 
  * Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains spaces. 
* In the same dialog, make sure that JAVA\_HOME exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0\_02 and that %JAVA\_HOME%\bin is in your Path environment variable.
* Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run the following to verify that it is correctly installed.

* Extract the distribution archive, i.e. **scalate-{project_new_version:}-unix-bin.tar.gz** to the directory you wish to install Scalate {project_new_version:}. These instructions assume you chose **/usr/local/scala**. The subdirectory scalate-{project_new_version:} will be created from the archive.
* In a command terminal, prepend the **PATH** variable with the bin directory in the scalate release. e.g.

      export PATH=/usr/local/scala/scalate-{project_new_version:}/bin:$PATH
    
* Make sure that **JAVA\_HOME** is set to the location of your JDK and that **$JAVA\_HOME/bin** is in your **PATH** environment variable, e.g. 

      export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_02
      export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    
* Run the following to verify that it is installed correctly
