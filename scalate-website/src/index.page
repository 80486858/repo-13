Scalate: Scala Template Engine
==============================

Scalate is a [Scala 2.8](http://www.scala-lang.org) based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)">template engine</a> for generating text and markup which can be used in the following [frameworks](documentation/frameworks.html) and environments:

* stand alone in any JVM
* as a servlet in any Java in a web application 
* when using JAXRS with [Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/)
* in the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org/) via [play-scalate](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate)
* in [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html) for transforming messages and templating

Scalate supports the following template formats

* [Mustache](documentation/mustache-reference.html) which is a Scala dialect of [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) for logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js)
* [Scaml](documentation/scaml-reference.html) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)
* [SSP](documentation/ssp-reference.html) which is like [Velocity](documentation/ssp-reference.html#velocity_style_directives), JSP or Erb from Rails 

Still confused? Check out [Why Scalate](why.html)? or how Scalate compares to [JSP](compare-jsp.html) or [Lift](code-in-view.html)
