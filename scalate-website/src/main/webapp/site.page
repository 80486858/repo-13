    # How it works

  :&markdown
    The *#{project_name}* documentation and site is created using [WebGen](http://webgen.rubyforge.org/) and is stored in git in the same [source control system as the code](source.html)

    # Editing the source code

    If you [grab the source code](source.html) you can get the site source in the *webgen* directory.
    If you have webgen installed (see below for instructions) then you can build the website from [the code](source.html) as follows

        cd scalate-website
        webgen
  
    If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

        webgen
    
    You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

    If you are on OS X then we highly recommend [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) as a great editor which supports Textile and Markdown
