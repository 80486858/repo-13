Scalate (Scala Template Engine)
===============================

This library implements a [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) based template engine of things like JSP and HAML.

All expressions inside Scalate are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your pages.

Two template languages are supported:

  * [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax): Provides a JSP, ASP, ERB style template language
  * [Scaml](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html#features): Provides Haml style template lanaguage

Scalate is based on code developed by [Matt Hildebrand](http://github.com/matthild/serverpages)
