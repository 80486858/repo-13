    Once you have installed the Scalate Tool via one of the above methods, you should be able to use the **scalate** executable on the command line.

    The scalate tool supports a number of sub commands rather like **git** or **svn**. You can invoke a sub command directly such as

        scalate run myTemplate.ssp

    you can get a list of all the available sub commands via

        scalate help

    or to get help on a specific command you can type

        scalate --help
    
    or enter the Scalate interactive shell via

        scalate
    
    Once in the shell help will apppear to help guide you through the available commands. The shell supports tab completion rather like bash to help you execute the commands easily.
