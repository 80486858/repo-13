Scalate: Scala Template Engine
==============================

Scalate is a [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) based template engine. Scalate can be used stand alone or as a servlet or renderer when using JAXRS with [Jersey](http://jersey.dev.java.net/).

Scalate supports SSP pages which are like JSP/ASP pages as well as [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/)

Compared to JSP, SSP misses out lots of stuff like EL, JSTL, tag libraries, tag files, JSP header files and lots of other stuff. In its place, scalate reuses the [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) language which is way more powerful and expressive than the EL in JSP. You can also invoke methods in regular Scala code which can use Scala's XML support to return page fragments.

All expressions inside SSP are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your pages. Also since SSP is based on Scala it generates fast statically typed method dispatch bytecode rather than using dynamic dispatch or reflection.

The code is based on [serverpages](http://github.com/matthild/serverpages) by Matt Hildebrand


Changes
-------
* added [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) build and experimental [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) build
* fixed issue where SSPs would not be recompiled if an error occurred compiling between application restarts
* fixed so it works in jetty-run and other servlet contexts; so we can reuse the ClassLoader if its a URLClassLoader
* added a PageContext so we can add helper methods like this to look up attributes or resources beans in a typesafe way
* updated the name mangling so that when using SSP views for JAXRS resource beans there's no need to import the package of the resource bean (as the SSP is generated in a child package)
* markup using Scala's Nodes are not XML encoded so they can be used to create markup
* numbers and dates use the request's locale by default to format themselves
