If you have a legacy site you want to port over from Confluence you can run the following command.
  
For example if your Confluence space is called FOO at Apache then the following command will dump its content as wiki text files...

    scalate confexport --user user --password pass \
      https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/rpc/xmlrpc FOO ./out
