    The *#{project_name}* documentation and site is created using Scalate and is stored in git in the same [source control system as the code](source.html)

    **Note:** For code highlighting you will need to [install](http://pygments.org/download/) [http://pygments.org/](http://pygments.org).

    If you [grab the source code](source.html) you can get the site source in the *scalate-website* directory.
    If you [have Scalate installed](documentation/installing.html) then you can build the website from [the code](source.html) as follows

    {pygmentize:: text}
    cd scalate-website
    mvn install
    {pygmentize}

    If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

    {pygmentize:: text}
    mvn jetty:run
    {pygmentize}

    You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

    If you are on OS X then we highly recommend [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) as a great editor which supports Textile and Markdown

    # Deploying the site
.right
  :markdown
    The site is automatically deployed by the CI builds, so you can simply wait for the changes to be automatically pushed 
    to the project site.
    
    You can manually deploy the site using Maven:
    
    {pygmentize:: text}
    mvn scalate:deploy
    {pygmentize}

    Though website deployment also occurs by default using the **deploy** goal in maven

    You will need to add the Scalate project's Web server to your Maven configuration:
    
    {pygmentize:: xml}
    <server>
      <id>website.fusesource.org</id>
      <username>xxxx</username>
      <password>xxxxx</password>
    </server>
    {pygmentize}
