## General Questions

General questions on the *{project_name:}* project.

### Why the name Scalate?

Scalate stands for Scala Template Engine hence ScalaTE, though its easier on the eye to just write 'Scalate'

### What is the license?

The license is [Apache 2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

### How do I get started?

Try the [Getting Started Guide](documentation/getting-started.html) which should have you *scalating* nicely really quickly!

### How do I get support?

See the [support guide](support.html) for more details.

### How do I build Scalate?

First [get the source](source.html) then see he [building guide](building.html)

### How do I contribute or become a committer?

We love [contributions](contributing.html)! More details on how to contribute and how to become a committer are in the [contributing guide](contributing.html).

### How do I register for the issue tracker?

For more detail see the [support page](support.html). If you haven't done so already you can  <a href=" https://www.assembla.com/user/signup">register with the issue tracker here</a>

### How does the website work?

For details on how to edit the website and how it works see [How the Site works](site.html)

## The Scalate Approach

### Should I use SSP or Scaml?

If you know JSP or Erb then you will feel right at home with [SSP](documentation/ssp-reference.html) which has very similar syntax - the main difference is its use of Scala for expressions.

However if you are generating markup, particularly HTML, then we highly recommend you take a look at [Scaml](documentation/scaml-reference.html) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/). Scaml is a little bit of an acquired taste - if you've never used HAML before it might seem a little odd at first; but when you get used to it we're sure you'll really like it.

While [SSP](documentation/ssp-reference.html) and [Scaml](documentation/scaml-reference.html) offer the same kinds of features and expressive power, using Scala expressions, iteration, navigation and pattern matching, [Scaml](documentation/scaml-reference.html) really shines for generating HTML and XML markup - its much more concise and DRY. [SSP](documentation/ssp-reference.html) is much better for generating arbitrary textual output such as emails as Scaml is highly optimised to nested markup and HTML in particular.

### How does Scalate compare to JSP?

See our [comparison of Scalate to JSP](compare-jsp.html)

### How does Scalate compare to Lift views?

We [compare approaches here](code-in-view.html), see which is right for you and your team.

### Isn't putting code in views a bad thing?

Well it all depends really; see [this article](code-in-view.html) for a more in depth debate on the subject.

## Using Scalate

### How do I get started?

Your best bet is starting with the [User Guide](documentation/index.html) maybe starting by [running the samples](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/index.html#running_the_samples) then for more detail reading either of the template references 

* [Ssp Reference](documentation/ssp-reference.html) 
* [Scaml Reference](documentation/scaml-reference.html) 

### How can I use Scalate and Scala in a RAD way?

Scalate itself auto-recompiles and reloads templates on the fly. However if you are changing Scala code which the Scalate templates use then you normally have to stop and restart your web container.

So for a more RAD approach we recommend using [JRebel](jrebel.html) which can hot-reload the Scala code on the fly, leading to a rapid edit &lt;-&gt; browser reload cycle.

### Can I use Scalate with a non file based template?

You can configure the [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html)  to provide a *resourceLoader* to resolve URIs for templates. See the [Custom Template Loading in the Embedding Guide](documentation/scalate-embedding-guide.html#custom_template_loading).

Or if you are using the Scalate API directly there are methods on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) API for loading a [Template](http://scalate.fusesource.org/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/Template.html) by supplying the source of the template as a String. So you can create the template content however you wish, then compile and render the template.

For example
{pygmentize:: scala}
// a template with an attribute 
val source = "<%@ val name: String %> hello ${name}" 

val template = engine.compileSsp(source) 
val output = engine.layout(template, Map("name" -> "James")) 

// test it works... 
expect("hello James") {output} 
{pygmentize}

To see more examples try the [TemplateEngineTest.scala test case](http://github.com/scalate/scalate/blob/master/scalate-core/src/test/scala/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngineTest.scala)
