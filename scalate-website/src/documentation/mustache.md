# Mustache

* Table of contents
{:toc}

Scalate's Mustache is a Scala/Java implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) template language.

Mustache provides logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js) - so ideal for HTML templates which your designers own. You can use a regular HTML file as the template and let your designer own it, using a little JavaScript file inject the template with sample data. Your Scala/Java developer can then use the template and inject the values on the server side using the real services and domain model.
