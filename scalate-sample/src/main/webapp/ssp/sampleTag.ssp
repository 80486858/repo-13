<h1>Sample Tag</h1>

<p>
  This page demonstrates a kinda pseudo custom tag in SSP.
  Notice how the method we invoke, <b>MyTags.someLayout</b> just takes a function
  which when invoked returns a String. So you can write a simple function to process the body of a 'tag'
  calling the body as many times as you like.
</p>

<% import org.fusesource.scalate.sample.MyTags._ %>

<%= someLayout { %>
this is some body!
<% } %>
