# Getting Started
Lets get scalating!

# Introduction
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets try and get you up to speed using Scalate as quickly as possible.

This guide will assume you have a reasonably recent installation of [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), say version 2.0.9 or later. If you don't, please [install one now](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).

Note that if you hit any issues during this guide you might want to check out the [FAQ](../faq.html).

# Create a project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Lets create a new [Jog](jog.html) project that we can use as a base on which to build.

If you have not done so already [install the Scalate Tool](tool.html). If you prefer you can create projects using the [Scalate Maven archetypes via maven](archetypes.html) instead of using Scalate Tool

To see all of the available commands type this command into a command terminal

      scalate

Now to create a new project type 

      scalate create guice myGroup myArtifact
    
You might want to change **myGroup** and **myArtifact** to whatever maven groupId and artifactId you want to use. 

Now change directory to the newly created **myArtifact** directory (or whatever name you used for the artifactId)  

      cd myArtifact  
    
You should now see a directory tree something like this

      src
      +--main
      |  |--resources
      |  +--scala
      |  |  |--myGroup
      |  +--webapp
      |     |--WEB-INF
      +--test
         +--scala
            |--myGroup

If this step didn't work, [let us know](../community.html)!

Hopefully you now have a base [Jog](jog.html) project using Scalate, Scala, [Jersey](https://jersey.dev.java.net/) and [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).

# Run the new project
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
To run the project run the following [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) command

      mvn jetty:run
        
Now when the application starts up you should be able to point your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run the application.

Your application is now ready for you to create new JAXRS resource beans (in Scala or Java code) as well as rendering any Scalate templates in the **src/main/webapp** directory.

To start hacking on a template, try editing the **src/main/webapp/index.scaml** file which is used to render the home page (a [Scaml](scaml-reference.html) template). Or try adding new templates. 

For more detail on how the web application works please refer to the [Jog documentation](jog.html)

# Scalate console
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
While looking at the [home page](http://localhost:8080) of your running application you should see a little icon near the top right of the screen which opens/closes the [Scalate Console](console.html). Try opening it and try out its links.

The [Scalate Console](console.html) provides nice error messages if you make a typo in a template together with edit links to the source code, plus provides handy links to the current source, templates and layouts you are viewing in development mode along with a number of other features. 

Please refer to the [Console documentation](console.html) for more detail.

# Using SBT
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
You can also compile the code with SBT (or [Simple build tool](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)) if you prefer instead of Maven. Type the following commands into a terminal (the first command enters the SBT shell)

      sbt
      update
      compile
    
At the time of writing there are [some issues with WAR overlays and SBT](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/issues/detail?id=87) so jetty-run might not work correctly.

# Diving deeper
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Once you have the application working and you've played with the [Console](console.html) you might want to dive deeper into Scalate and understand how it works.

* [FAQ](../faq.html) if you hit any issues along the way
* [WAR Overlay](war-overlay.html) describes how we use a WAR overlay to include the [Console](console.html) in your application
* [Scalate Console](console.html)
