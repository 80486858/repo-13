    Lets try and get you up to speed using Scalate as quickly as possible.

    This guide will assume you have a reasonably recent installation of [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), say 
    version 2.0.9 or later. If you don't, please [install one now](http://maven.apache.org/download.html).

    Note that if you hit any issues during this guide you might want to check out the [FAQ](../faq.html).

    # Create a project
.right
  :markdown

    Lets create a new webapp project that we can use as a base on which to build. If you have not done so already,
    [install the Scalate Tool](installing.html).  Now to create a new project run:

          scalate create jersey mygroup myartifactid
    
    Change the **mygroup** and **myartifactid** to whatever maven group id and artifact id you want to use. 

    Now change directory to the newly created **myartifactid** directory (or whatever name you used for the artifact id)  

          cd myartifactid  
    
    You should now see a directory tree something like this

          src
          +--main
          |  |--resources
          |  +--scala
          |  |  |--mygroup
          |  +--webapp
          |     |--WEB-INF
          +--test
             +--scala
                |--mygroup

    If this step didn't work, [let us know](../community.html)!

    This has created a basic skeleton module that be be built using SBT or Maven which generates a web application which
    has Scalate integrated.

    # Building with Maven

.right
  :markdown
    To run the project run the following [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) command

          mvn jetty:run
        
    Now when the application starts up you should be able to point your browser at 
    [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run the application.

    Your application is now ready for you to create new JAXRS resource beans (in Scala 
    or Java code) as well as rendering any Scalate templates in the **src/main/webapp** directory.

    To start hacking on a template, try editing the **src/main/webapp/index.scaml** file which is 
    used to render the home page (a [Scaml](scaml-reference.html) template). Or try adding new templates.

    # Building with SBT

    You can also compile the code with SBT (or [Simple build tool](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)) 
    if you prefer instead of Maven. Type the following commands into a terminal (the first command enters the SBT shell)
    
          sbt
          update
          compile

    # Scalate Console

.right
  :markdown
    While looking at the [home page](http://localhost:8080) of your running application 
    you should see a little icon near the top right of the screen which opens/closes 
    the [Scalate Console](console.html). Try opening it and try out its links.

    The [Scalate Console](console.html) provides nice error messages if you make a typo 
    in a template together with edit links to the source code, plus provides handy links 
    to the current source, templates and layouts you are viewing in development mode along 
    with a number of other features. 

    Please refer to the [Console documentation](console.html) for more detail.

    Once you have the application working and you've played with the [Console](console.html) you 
    might want to dive deeper into Scalate and understand how it works.
