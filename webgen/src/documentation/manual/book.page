== Preface

Scalate is a template engine based on the Scala language.

Scalate supports SSP pages which are like JSP/ASP pages in syntax but using Scala code for expressions instead of Java or EL like in JSP.

Scalate also supports the http://haml-lang.com/[Haml] syntax

Scalate currently requires a Java 5 runtime and a servlet 2.5 container, or newer.


== Chapter 1

If you know JSP or ASP then hopefully the syntax is familiar; only using Scala as the language of expressions and method invocations.

=== Syntax

Declarations:

----
<%@ attribute someName: String = "someDefaultValue" %>
----

Code blocks:

----
<% import com.acme.MySnipets._ %>
----

Expressions:

----
<%= someExpression %>
${someExpression}  
----

=== Includes

You can include other scripts in your page using the include method

----
<% include file="relativeOrAbsoluteURL" %>
----

The URL is then evaluated and included in place in your template.

=== Custom tags

In JSP there is a concept of custom tags which can process a block of the template such as for looping or transforming content.

For example if you want to XML escape a block of a template you can just invoke the *xmlEscape* method.

----
<%= xmlEscape {%>
  this will be escaped... 
  hello ${user.name} 
<% } %>
----


=== Variables

The following variables are in scope inside your page

[grid="rows"]
[options="header"]
|===========================
|Variable | Type | Description
|context | TemplateContext | the page context which is imported to provide helper methods like attribute() as described below
|out | PrintWriter | the printer of the output
|request | HttpServletRequest | the servlet request
|response | HttpServletResponse | the servlet response
|===========================


=== Working with attributes

Its a common requirement to parameterise your template such as to pass in some model object from a servlet/controller or to pass in the resource bean in JAXRS.

To define an attribute in your template use the following declaration

----
<%@ attribute foo: MyType %>
----

We use a syntax similar to defining arguments in a method; so you can take advantage of default argument values.

----
<%@ attribute bar: String = "this is the default value" %>
----

The attribute is now available for use as an expression. 

Its very common to have a template based on a single model object such that the template takes a single attribute; so the default behaviour is to import the first defined attribute in your page.

For example

----
<%@ attribute it: Person %>
<%@ attribute errorMessage: String = "" %>

Hello ${name}, what is the weather like in your ${city}

${errorMessage}
----

In the above scalate is basically including the following code to import all the attributes and methods of the local variable _it_

----
<% import it._ %>
----

so that we can use expressions such as *name* instead of *it.name* for brevity

== JAX-RS

When working with the https://jersey.dev.java.net/[Jersey] implementation of JAX-RS you can use template engines as implicit views of your resources.

To do this just add the *@ImplicitProduces* annotation to your resource bean, then create a SSP file called *className.index.ssp"
in a directory named after the package name of your class.

For example if your resource bean is called org.fusesource.scalate.sample.resources.FooResource then create a file in your webapp called *org/fusesource/scalate/samples/resources/FooResource.index.ssp*

Then you refer to the resource bean by declaring an attribute

----
<%@ attribute it: FooResource %>
----

You can now refer to the resource bean directly and invoke any methods on it; all the attributes and methods on the object are imported so you don't have to use _it.method_ you can just use _method_ to invoke a method 

== Building

Install http://maven.apache.org/[maven] version 2.0.9 or later. Then type

----
mvn
----

To run the sample web application

----
cd scalate-sample
mvn jetty:run
----

Then open http://localhost:8080/[the sample home page]


== Adding Scalate to your application


1.  Add something like the following to your web.xml file:

----
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>SspServlet</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>org.fusesource.scalate.scala_.ScalaServerPageServlet</servlet-class>
  <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
----

----
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>SspServlet</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>*.ssp</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----

2.  Include the following JARs in your servlet's runtime environment (probably in WEB-INF/lib):

* scala-compiler.jar
* scala-library.jar
* scalate-core.jar

You could add one or more of the above to your servlet container's server-wide configuration if you prefer


=== Possible Gotchas

- Works with expanded WARs - or servlet containers who's ClassLoader implements URLClassLoader

- Assumes SSP page source files are all UTF-8-encoded.

- Assumes SSP pages' output is all UTF-8-encoded.

- No support for precompilation (e.g., via a custom Ant task).

- Yes, there really is an underscore in "org.fusesource.scalate.scala\_.ScalaServerPageServlet"; the Scala compiler issued errors without the underscore in the package name.
