## Using Scalate

### How do I get started?

Your best bet is starting with the [User Guide](documentation/index.html) maybe starting by [running the samples](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/index.html#running_the_samples) then for more detail reading either of the template references 

* [Ssp Reference](documentation/ssp-reference.html) 
* [Scaml Reference](documentation/scaml-reference.html) 

### How can I use Scalate and Scala in a RAD way

Scalate itself auto-recompiles and reloads templates on the fly. However if you are changing Scala code which the Scalate templates use then you normally have to stop and restart your web container.

So for a more RAD approach we recommend using [JRebel](jrebel.html) which can hot-reload the Scala code on the fly, leading to a rapid edit &lt;-&gt; browser reload cycle.
